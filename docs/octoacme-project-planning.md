# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Cross-Functional Inputs to Planning

To reduce handoff ambiguity, the following roles contribute specific inputs during planning activities:

- **UX/UI Designer**: Provides wireframes or design specs for user-facing stories; flags any stories requiring usability testing before acceptance criteria are finalized
- **Business Analyst**: Elaborates acceptance criteria, documents business rules, and ensures stories are traceable to business objectives; facilitates requirement workshops when scope is unclear
- **DevOps Engineer**: Identifies infrastructure, environment, or pipeline dependencies; contributes to the Definition of Done by specifying deployment, monitoring, and security-scan gate requirements
- **Customer Support Lead**: Reviews planned features for support-readiness implications (e.g., documentation needs, FAQ updates, escalation paths); flags known customer pain points that may inform priority

These inputs should be collected during backlog refinement sessions before stories are pulled into sprint planning.

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
